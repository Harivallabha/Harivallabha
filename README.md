### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer by day, Batman by night. I'm broadly interested in algorithms, reliability and performance. Here's a link to my [personal blog!](https://harivallabha.github.io/)

Passionate about driving the latest research to a state of realization in the industry. Iâ€™m looking for challenging exposure that would enable me to ideate, design, deploy, and maintain reliably robust large-scale learning systems.

Currently, I'm a final year undergrad pursuing a double major in Math and Computer Science.
